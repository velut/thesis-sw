This repository contains the software and datasets used in the *Cost-effective and Scalable Activity Matching using Crowdsourcing* thesis.

## Directories

- `tasks` contains crowdsourcing tasks' designs, input data, instructions, and images. It also contains support material used for crowdsourcing (images, cost predictors).
- `direct_approaches` contains the data analysis and plotting algorithms used for direct approaches (1:1, 1:N, N:M).
- `indirect_approaches` contains BOT performance analysis and cosine similarity algorithm implementation and performance analysis
- `gold_standard` contains the gold standard files representing the ground truth used to evaluate the performance of approaches
- `cost_analysis` contains the data analysis and plotting algorithms used for analyzing the cost of approaches
